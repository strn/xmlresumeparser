# xmlresumeparser

The goal of this project is to allow separation of resume (CV) data from their presentation. User should write CV data in XML format (either HR-XML or XmlResume) and then produce CV using one of transformation methods.

For the time being, only this process is supported:

CV data (HRXML format) -> AsciiDoc format -> HTML format -> PDF format
